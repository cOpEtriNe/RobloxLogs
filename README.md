# RobloxLogs
My Roblox activity logs.

As you sort through the logs from oldest to newest, you'll notice changes in how the logs are layed out.
I.e. new data might appear in the logs e.g. hours in game, game id, processs crashing etc.
This is just me playing around with my logger. 
There is no real use for these logs, but for me to see what I was doing on Roblox at the time.
