# RobloxLogs
My Roblox activity logs.

As you sort through the logs from oldest to newest, you'll notice changes in how the logs are layed out.
I.e. new data might appear in the logs e.g. hours in game, game id, processs crashing etc.
This is just me playing around with my logger. 
There is no real use for these logs, but for me to see what I was doing on Roblox at the time.

2025-04-22.txt is the first log ever uploaded here. It is pretty small and logs only small details the day when the logger was made.
The next day, which is today, more is added to the logger.

This will probably either go private or i'll stop uploading here and create a new log repository.
This is because I might not be on github or Roblox as much.
